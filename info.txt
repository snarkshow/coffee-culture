- copy of the array (Array.from())
- and now there's a new Array
- generate random number that represents an index from the array 
- and then you have to remove the item from the array because you don't want to repeat the choice
- when you pull the number out of the array, you have to pop it off the end because otherwise when you randomize the number it'll be too high (because you can't choose the same item more than once)
